Trivia: Create, play, and compete with friends

**Functionality**
Users can easily create their own trivia game using selector buttons for the category and difficulty level.

After completion of the game, the user can decide either to _'save'_ (and share) the game or to _'trash'_ the game.

If user selects the _'trash'_ button, they are redirected to create a new game.

If user selects the _'save'_ button, they are prompted to;

1. see their score
1. create a username
1. enter their email
1. copy the link to this game to send to friends
1. or enter friends' email address for invites
1. make a comment to _taunt_ their friends - which will be visible on the leaderboard
1. at the end they can create a new trivia game, too

All players of the same game will be able to _taunt_ eachother on the leaderboard and see each others' scores.

**Usefulness**
Users are able to interact with their friends and family members.

Users are able to be creative in deciding which parameters they'd like for the trivia game they make.

Trivia is a great way to test your knowledge and keep a sharpened brain (like a pencil).

**Getting Started**
Users can easily get started just by selecting which category and difficulty level they'd like to create a trivia game.

They are given a few small fields to fill out only after having taken the test and when they wish to share it with friends.

They will be asked for a username and email to verify the account.

They will be given a link or offered to share emails to their friends in order to share the game.

**Getting Help**
The directions are easy to follow and don't require many steps. Buttons are clearly marked. Most interaction within the app is amongst the user and their invited friends.
